## Abstract
Survival analysis is a hotspot in statistical research for modelling time-to-event information
with data censorship handling, which has been widely used in many applications such as
clinical research, information system and other fields with survivorship bias. Many works
have been proposed for survival analysis ranging from traditional statistic methods to machine
learning and deep learning methods. This paper examines novel deep learning techniques for
survival analysis in credit risk modelling context. After surveying through literature for deep
learning survival analysis models in various domains and categorizing them, we evaluate the
adequacy of six different models representing different categories, using two datasets of US
mortgages from separate sources. The performance of these models is evaluated using the
discrimination metric, concordance index.
